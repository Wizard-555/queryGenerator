# QueryGenerator

## Overview

QueryGenerator is a full-fledged web application with a frontend and backend that facilitates intelligent data retrieval from SQL or NoSQL databases. The system identifies the database type (SQL/NoSQL) and processes user queries by directly interacting with the provided database. It then returns results in a structured format, offering data visualization and an interactive dashboard for a comprehensive view of database details.

## Objective

The primary goal of QueryGenerator is to simplify and automate data retrieval from user-provided databases. Instead of generating queries for users, the system securely connects to the provided database, processes natural language inputs, and retrieves meaningful results. The system enhances data accessibility by visualizing query results and offering insights through a structured dashboard. This ensures efficient decision-making and real-time database monitoring.

## Purpose & Real-World Applications

- **Seamless Data Retrieval**: Directly interacts with user-provided databases to fetch data.
- **Database Compatibility**: Adapts dynamically to SQL and NoSQL databases.
- **Enhanced Data Visualization**: Provides graphical representation of results for better understanding.
- **Dashboard for Database Insights**: Displays key database metrics and query results for monitoring.
- **Enterprise-Level Data Handling**: Supports organizations in managing and querying their data efficiently.

## Features to Be Developed

- Securely connect to user-provided SQL/NoSQL databases.
- Process natural language queries and retrieve relevant results.
- Provide structured query results without exposing direct query execution.
- Offer dynamic visualizations based on the retrieved data.
- Develop an interactive dashboard displaying database insights and metrics.
